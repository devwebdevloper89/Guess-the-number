# Guess the Number Game - README

## Introduction
🎮 Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! This is a retro-style game where players are tasked with guessing a random number between 1 and 20. If the player guesses the correct number, their score will increase, and the game will keep track of their high score. This project is built using simple JavaScript code to help you develop your understanding of functions and event handling in web development. 🚀

## Features
✨ Randomly generated numbers between 1 and 20.
🌟 User-friendly interface.
🔢 Keep track of your current score.
🏆 Maintain a high score for each session.
🧩 Easy-to-understand JavaScript code for beginners.
